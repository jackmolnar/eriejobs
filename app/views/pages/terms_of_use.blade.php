            <h2>8. EriePaJobs's Liability.</h2>
            <p>
                The EriePaJobs Sites act as, among other things, venues for (i) employers to post job opportunities and search for and evaluate job candidates and (ii) candidates to post resumes and Profiles and search for and evaluate job opportunities. EriePaJobs does not screen or censor the listings, including Profiles offered. EriePaJobs is not involved in, and does not control, the actual transaction between employers and candidates. As a result, EriePaJobs is not responsible for User Content, the quality, safety or legality of the jobs or resumes posted, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of employers to offer job opportunities to candidates or the ability of candidates to fill job openings and EriePaJobs makes no representations about any jobs, resumes or User Content on the EriePaJobs Sites. While EriePaJobs reserves the right in its sole discretion to remove User Content, job postings, resumes or other material from the EriePaJobs Sites from time to time, EriePaJobs does not assume any obligation to do so and to the extent permitted by law, disclaims any liability for failing to take any such action.
                EriePaJobs Networking provides a venue for individuals to network for professional and personal purposes and EriePaJobs does not screen or censor the Profiles or User Content on the EriePaJobs Sites. EriePaJobs is not involved in the actual communications between Users. As a result, EriePaJobs has no control over the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of the Profiles or User Content submitted on the EriePaJobs Sites and makes no representations about any Profile or User Content on the EriePaJobs Sites.
                Note that there are risks, including but not limited to the risk of physical harm, of dealing with strangers, underage persons or people acting under false pretenses. You assume all risks associated with dealing with other users with whom You come in contact through the EriePaJobs Sites. By its very nature other people’s information may be offensive, harmful or inaccurate, and in some cases will be mislabeled or deceptively labeled. We expect that You will use caution and common sense when using the EriePaJobs Sites.
                Because User authentication on the Internet is difficult, EriePaJobs cannot and does not confirm that each User is who they claim to be.
